# Hello Everyone! :wave:

Welcome to my coding corner! I'm a junior software engineer from Egypt, currently navigating the Computer Science and Engineering world at Mansoura University. Embarking on my learning journey a year ago, I've been following the Open Source Society University (OSSU) curriculum with a keen focus on long-term gains and a passion for perpetual learning.

This readme serves as a glimpse into my world of coding, where planning, design, and code converge to bring projects to life. Join me as I share my top projects, skills, and the ongoing chapters of my learning adventure.

Let's dive in! 👨‍💻✨
